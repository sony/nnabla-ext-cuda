/** This class can be used in Function::setup to prepare for the reduction
    CUDA kernel called in Function::forward or Function::backward.

    The input shape are integrated to the two dimension (size_y, size_x)
    according to reduction axes; one part is the collection of reduction axes
    and the other part is the collection of the other axes. However
    the terminology x and y are determined for easier understanding of
    the implemented algorithm as follow.
      - x: the integrated dimensions including memory continuous dimension.
      - y: otherwise

    For example, let an input shape (2, 3, 4, 5) and an reduction axes (0, 2).
    The dimensional part of x is (3, 5). That of y is (2, 4). Then
      - (ndim_y, ndim_x) = (2, 2)
      - (size_y, size_x) = (8, 15).

    The original strides are (60, 20, 5, 1). Then
      - strides_x_input = (20, 1)
      - strides_y_input = (60, 5)
      - strides_x = (5, 1), which is the strides of the x-part shape (3, 5)
      - strides_y = (4, 1), which is the strides of the y-part shape (2, 4)
